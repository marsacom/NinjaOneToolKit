This script uses the NinjaOne API to get devices associated with specified organizations and compare with a list of computers in an XLSX Sheet to verify what devices we do and do not have registered in Ninja.

With this we can then go back through the XLSX Sheet and know which devices we have yet to add to Ninja.
